=== Features
This application provides an easy way to perform the most common configuration tasks on a YubiKey.

The current version can:

* Display the serial number and firmware version of a YubiKey
* Configure a FIDO2 PIN
* Reset the FIDO Applications
* Configure the OTP Application. A YubiKey have two slots (Short Touch and Long Touch), which may both be configured for different functionality.
This tool can configure a https://developers.yubico.com/OTP/[Yubico OTP] credential, a static password, a challenge-response credential or an https://developers.yubico.com/OATH/[OATH] HOTP credential in both of these slots.
* Manage certificates and PINs for the PIV Application
* Swap the credentials between two configured slots
* Enable and disable USB and NFC interfaces
