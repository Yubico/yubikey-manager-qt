== Project outline

YubiKey Manager is a Qt5 application written in QML that uses the plugin PyOtherSide to enable
the backend logic to be written in Python 3. The python library yubikey-manager is needed to
communicate with the YubiKey, and may be installed from pip or other package managers.
If a specific version (or branch or commit) is needed for development, point to that version
in requirements.txt

== Working with the code

    $ qmake-qt5 && make

=== Run the app

    $ ./ykman-gui/ykman-gui

=== Code Style & Linting

This project uses http://flake8.pycqa.org/[Flake8] (for the python parts) and qmllint
(for the QML parts) for code style with a http://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit] hook.

To use these:

    $ pip install pre-commit flake8
    $ pre-commit install

=== Packaging

For third-party packaging, use the source releases and signatures available https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager-qt/Releases/[here].
